The database setup should be easy - our scrum goals show setting up two databases, but in reality we should setup
a database to hold at least:
	- prescribers, with a list of patients as an attribute
	- patients, with a list of PHQ-9 scores as an attribute
	- potentially, PHQ-9 scores and their corresponding medication recommendations

The point is we will need to design an ER diagram to figure out how the database should be structured. Next, we
will have to code those models as classes in python files. Finally, we should be able to make the database
migrations and django will automatically give us GUI control of the database through the admin site.

These steps were found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Models

After creating models in models.py, you must run migrations with python3 manage.py makemigrations, then python3 manage.py migrate. Finally, you must register the models in admin.py.

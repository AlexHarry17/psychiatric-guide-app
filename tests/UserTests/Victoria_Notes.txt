- prompts are good, patient information laid out well
  - provider is "giving" PHQ-9, MDQ, not "taking" it (change wording)
  - New patient form - typically patient would fill out individual information;
  current step and down would be filled out by prescriber. So, this may require
  separating these forms. Patient info would be done before visit, step info and
  next visit would be done during the visit
  - Notes shouldn't be required upon filling out new patient form
  - Provider needs a way to diagnose patient's program and potentially change
  that program
  - Treament overview page, algorithm page maybe add print button so info
  could be printed for patient as intended. Printing from browser doesn't look right
  	- some of the info on treatment overview is not applicable to the
  	patient, such as discontinution/change of dosing, as the doctor
  	chooses this
  	- basically, prescriber should have access to different info than
  	patient
  - Medications page - if you go back from viewing a medication, should display
  card that you were just on

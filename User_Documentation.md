## 1.1 Project Description

Prescribing the right medicine and treatment is difficult, and most medical professionals depend on prescribing
pocket guides to help ensure the best treatment plan possible is given to their patients. One major issue psychiatric
prescribers have is that there is no electronic version of the clinical practice guidelines they use every day. They
 must find the needed information by looking through paper copies, which can add unnecessary time and frustration to
 both the prescribers and the patient's experience. This projects aim is to provide an electronic intuitive guide and
 tool to help psychiatric prescribers give the best care they possibly can to their patients.      

The web application designed to accomplish this task will help simplify and organize the psychiatric prescription
process. Having all the prescribing guidelines stored in a digital format also allows the provided information to
be easily updated and immediately distributed. This helps medical professionals provide more accurate treatment
plans to the people that need it. The information provided on this application is based on the "Prescribing Pocket
Guide 2012", which deals with prescribing in the domain of both Depression and Bipolar disorder. In the future,
this app could be expanded into other medical domains. The website provides a central location for doctors to
reference information in the pocket guide as well as track patient progress through the different treatment processes.


## 1.2 Before Getting Started


Only certified psychiatric prescribers are permitted to create an account to view and track patient information.  
Anyone can view the information provided in the general Prescribing Pocket Guide on our website.

## 2.1 How To Visit the Webpage

Obtaining the software is as easy as visiting a website. There are no downloads necessary, as it is a web-hosted
application that can be accessed anywhere by following The link below.

# 3. How to Use the Web App



---


You must be registered as a prescriber to login and use the site. When logged in, a prescriber may access a list of patients, treatment overview information for the treatment options available, and a list of medications for those treatments. Under the patient list, the prescriber may select a patient and view information about them, including visit history, treatment algorithm and corresponding step, medications, PHQ-9/MDQ results, and other personal information necessary. The prescriber also has the option register a new patient from the patients list. From a patient's home page, a prescriber may allow for a patient to take the PHQ-9 or MDQ form and update their score. A patient's information can be edited manually by clicking the Edit Patient button.

The PHQ-9 and MDQ forms only require that a prescriber turn the screen toward the patient and let them select answers based on the questions asked. The prescriber could also just ask the patient the questions and record their answer. At the end, the results of the form are shown for the prescriber to assess further and update the list of patient scores. Suggestions for prescriptions and related warnings based on score change are displayed after saving to the patient. The corresponding step that the patient is on is shown in the patient information, and to see where to go from there the prescriber must go to the Algorithm tab on the left side.

The Algorithm tab contains the steps laid out for the Depression, Bipolar Depressed, and Bipolar Manic treatment algorithms as shown in the Prescribing Pocket Guide 2012. The default display is the Depression algorithm, but the Select Algorithm button in the top left can be used to choose among the three. In the case of the layout needing to be changed, an administrator could login and see another button here that says "Edit Layout". This opens up options for moving the steps around in a drag-and-drop manner and rearranging links to steps. So, if a treatment had a few steps that needed to be changed or rearranged, there would not be a lot of overhead to do so.

The Treatment Overview page shows general information about the treatment types that a patient may need to be aware of. This page is designed to be printed by the prescriber and given to the patient if they would like. It contains miscellaneous information that is not located elsewhere on the site.

The Medications page displays relevant medications used in the three treatment algorithms. These contain information such as generic and brand names, dosing, titration, comments, and side effects. Information from this page could also be printed and given to a patient if necessary.

The last two tabs are helpful to bridge the gap between developers and users - the Report a Bug page allows a user to submit a bug, which is explained next, and the Documentation tab simply links to the hosted documentation from GitHub.

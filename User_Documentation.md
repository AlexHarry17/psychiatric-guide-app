# Psychiatric Prescribers Guide: User Support

# 1. Web Application Overview

## 1.1 Project Description

Prescribing the right medicine and treatment is difficult, and most medical professionals depend on prescribing pocket guides to help ensure the best treatment plan possible is given to their patients. One major issue psychiatric prescribers have is that there is no electronic version of the clinical practice guidelines they use every day. They must find the needed information by looking through paper copies, which can add unnecessary time and frustration to both the prescribers and the patient's experience. This projects aim is to provide an electronic intuitive guide and tool to help psychiatric prescribers give the best care they possibly can to their patients.      

The web application designed to accomplish this task will help simplify and organize the psychiatric prescription process. Having all the prescribing guidelines stored in a digital format also allows the provided information to be easily updated and immediately distributed. This helps medical professionals provide more accurate treatment plans to the people that need it. The information provided on this application is based on the "Prescribing Pocket Guide 2012", which deals with prescribing in the domain of both Depression and Bipolar disorder. In the future, this app could be expanded into other medical domains. The website provides a central location for doctors to reference information in the pocket guide as well as track patient progress through the different treatment processes.
